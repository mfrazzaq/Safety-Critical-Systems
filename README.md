# Safety-Critical-Systems
This Repo will have all topics of safety-critical systems which is being taught in the HIS program at Frankfurt University

# Complexity in software development 
--> Complexity in software development refers to the complex nature of designing, implementing, and maintaining software that plays a crucial role in ensuring a system's safety and reliability.

--> Here are the some aspects

## Stringent Requirements 
  --> SCSs often have stringent and precise requirements that must be met.
  --> These requirements come from regulatory bodies, industry standards, or specific safety standards applicable to the domain.

## Integration and Compliance
--> SCS is subject to rigorous certification processes to ensure it complies with safety standards.
--> The documentation and evidence required for certification can significantly increase the complexity of the development process.

## Fault Tolerance and Redundancy
--> Building bag/error-free systems with redundancy is common in SC Applications.
--> Implementation and testing redundancy mechanisms, such as backup systems or failover strategies, add complexity to the software architecture. 

## Real-time constraints 
--> SCS meeting deadlines and response time requirements add complexity to software design

## Verification and Validation
--> V&V for SC software are extensive.
--> Rigorous testing, simulation, and formal verification methods are often used to ensure that software behaves correctly under all conditions.

## Integrating the legacy systems into new systems adds complexity

## Human Factors, trying to design user-friendly systems add complexity to the systems
